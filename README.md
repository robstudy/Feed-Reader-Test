This project runs javascript tests using jasmine.js on a UdacityBlog RSS feed reader application. Test code is located in feedreader.js.

Please visit http://robstudy.github.io/Feed-Reader-Test/  to run a live version of the project.

There are seven tests being run:
1. All RSS feeds are defined.
2. Url's are defined and not empty.
3. Names of feeds are defined and not empty.
4. The toggled menu is hidden by default.
5. The menu changes visibility when menu button is clicked.
6. There is at least one entry after the loadFeed() function is called.
7. That the content of the feeds change when a new one is loaded.

Current Issue: Repository out of date, RSS feeds need updating
